# API-Capstone-Final
My API project is using the yummly api website to get all the data from all the recipes. From there, I want to create an allergy filter for all peoples' needs. Also, making all cuisines from the whole world accessable in trying out new cultures and learn about how to make them. This is a great way for people who are foodies and like to cook with ingredients that can be used to help fulfill anything they cannot ingest due to the specific allergies. By using the yummly api this will generate many recipes from the website and organize anyone's needs to eat any cuisine in the world and enjoy it.
